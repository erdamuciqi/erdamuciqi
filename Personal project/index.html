                <div class="line"></div>
                <p>Cities are more than just places to live â€” they are hubs for opportunity, engines of upward mobility, and catalysts for human connection. As urban populations continue to grow, the potential of cities to improve quality of life and foster human connection becomes ever more critical. Tracking how cities perform on key metrics helps designers, governments, and city planners to make their cities more livable, more competitive, and more magnetic.</p>
